<h1>The Best Novels According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Novels of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Overgeared</h3>
<p>
  All hail god grid. This is one of the most amazing novels ever. The author is
  a genius who strings together plot points like a Master Tailor. The world
  building is so good, You would suspect the author to be an expert builder. I'd
  rate this novel an Only One.

<h3>Reincarnation of The Strongest Sword God</h3>
<p>
  A very promising title. While the novel has it's flaws, I would not want to
  miss reading this one. If only Lucky Old Cat could keep up with the complex
  and massive story he himself created, maybe we'd have a true masterpiece to
  read. This story is like a unfinished myth tier item, while incomplete it
  still packs enough punch compared to everything else.

<h3>Versatile Mage</h3>
<p>
  A novel whose ending I don't particularly fancy. But the ending is not all
  there is to a novel. The better part of the novel is so good, it is worth
  reading. I suspect the author is a massive simp and especially loves the cold
  beauties after reading that ending.
